The dataset includes 1539 images.
Fractured bone are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random shear of between -2째 to +2째 horizontally and -2째 to +2째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
